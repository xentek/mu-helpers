Helper functions to make developing solutions with WordPress MU or BuddyPress easierâ€¦

== Description ==

Helper functions to make developing solutions with WordPress MU or BuddyPress easier. Right now there is a function to return all posts from all blogs, and one to return all comments on all blogs. The code is well commented with phpdoc blocks, so read the source for more info. This plugin is for developers and will do nothing on its own (except provide functions to developers that don't exist in the core API)

== Installation ==

1. Download the mu-helpers.zip file, unzip and upload the whole directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Utilize the functions it provides in building your own plugins or in your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want this? =

If you've ever tried to develop complex solutions with WordPress MU or BuddyPress then no doubt you've found that there are quite a few functions missing from the API, especially when trying to pull content from all of the blogs on your MU instance. This plugin represents an evolving library of functions to make these types of tasks easier to complete.
